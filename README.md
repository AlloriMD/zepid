# zepid
zepid is an epidemiology analysis package, providing easy to use tools for epidemiologists coding in python3. Basic calculations are provided for both summary data and directly with raw data. Many of the more complicated package elements (ex. delta beta sensitivity analysis) are still underdevelopment. Basic measures of associations are fully implemented but still require some testing. Measures of association have been compared to SAS v9.4 to validate calculations.


# Contents include:
    -Measures of association, directly on dataframe
    -Measures of association, on summary data
    -Screening measures (sensitivity, specificity, NPV, PPV, etc.)
    -Sensitivity analysis tools
    -Forest plot generator
    -Other various calculations

Package is still mostly underdevelopment still. 
# Current items to be added still:
    -ICR and IC calculations
    -Confidence interval calculations for risk
    -Delta beta function for sensitivity analysis
    -Network analysis tools to complement NetworkX
